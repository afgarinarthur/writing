## Writing 📝

   Hi, I'm Arthur and today I will talk about "Schools get involved with activities in their local community".
I think that is very important the schools get involved in this projects. <br>
  
   The School can help people with food, for needy people. That's a very good thing to do. The needy people, usually can't get a bread piece, I think that's a good campaign for all people. Other thing the School can help, is the winter clothes campaign, for needy people. When the winter comes, street people need clothes that keep them warm, many of these people even die at dawn, which is usually the coldest time. The School can help with recycling campaigns. That's is a very good idea, because the nature it has a lot of accumulated plastic, and when we reduce it helps to preserve it. Many animals every year dies because eat plastic. <br>

   The negative part of this things. Depending on the food, the people who received it are unable to preserve it, leaving the food spoiled and unable to eat. Some people who don't think about their neighbors end up donating clothes that are torn or in poor condition, which makes it impossible for the people who received them to use them. Many politicians usually end up taking advantage of recycling campaigns, they do it in bad faith, thinking only about votes and about their own image to the population. <br>

The final consideration. I think all campaigns to help society is good, but if you take advantage of it for your own benefit, I don't think it's good. These actions are for the benefit of everyone and not just one person.
